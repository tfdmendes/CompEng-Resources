# Example: if statements.

N = int(input("N? "))

if N > 10:
    print("A")

if N % 2 == 0:
    print("B")

print("END")

# Think and answer:
# Which values of N make the program print A?
# Which values of N make the program print B?
# Does the program always print END?
# Can the program print both A and B?
# Can the program print B then A then END?
